# VSCode-CPP-DevSetup

## Description

This repository provides a streamlined setup for C++ development in Visual Studio Code. It emphasizes:
- Out-of-source builds using `CMake` and `make`.
- Individual executable generation for each `.cpp` file.
- Keeping the workspace clean by avoiding unnecessary files and directories in the root.

## Setup

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/VSCode-CPP-DevSetup.git
   cd VSCode-CPP-DevSetup
```

2. Ensure you have CMake and make installed:
```bash
  cmake --version
  make --version
```
Open the project in Visual Studio Code.

Press F5 in any .cpp file to compile and debug.
